SUPPORT:

There won't be much!  I'm afraid I don't have the resources to set up a users'
forum or even answer most emails I get on this.

If you send me an email indicating your inerest, I will put you on a mailing
list to announce new releases with bug fixes and/or new features.  If you
don't already have it, my address is drhamann@mat-simresearch.com.

For major help, I can be hired as a consultant through Mat-Sim Research LLC,
on terms we can discuss.

How YOU CAN SUPPORT the ONCVPSP project:

If you have added bug fixes and/or new features, you are free to do what you
want with them under the GNU General Public License.  However, if you'd like
to contribute to the project and you follow the coding standards in doc,
I'll be happy to consider your additions.

If you would like to contribute data files you've created for additional
elements which produce potentials of quality compable to the tests/refs 
examples, I will include them in the new users_data directory.
