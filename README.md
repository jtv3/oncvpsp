# oncvpsp
ONCVPSP code from D. R. Hamann, modifications for use with OCEAN

The hard work was done by D. R. Hamann and [Mat-Sim Research](http://www.mat-simresearch.com)
This version has been modified for use with [OCEAN](www.ocean-code.com). 

## Usage
Download from releases or the latest version from the OCEAN branch to use oncvpsp.x with the OCEAN code. Do not use this as a starting poing for improving pseudopotential generation! The OCEAN branch is very messy, and it contains a lot of code that is only important for OCEAN.
