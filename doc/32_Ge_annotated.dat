#
###lmax maximum angular momentum for which psp is calculated (<=3)
#
# lmax

#
#
### l angular momentum 
### rc  core radius for this l
### ep  energy at which psp is generated (eigenvalue inserted for occupied 
###     state in reference configuration, positive energy must be specified
###     for barrier-confined "scattering" state for unoccupied l <=lmax
###     A small positive energy is usually  good (0.1-0.25 Ha).
### ncon number of constraints for pseudo wave function to match all-
###      electron wave function at rc, value + ncon-1 derivatives,
###      must be between 3 and 5 ("M" in the paper, Eq.(6))
### nbas number of basis functions.  Must be between ncon+2 and ncon+5
###      ("N" in the paper, Eqs.(4-5))

#
# LOCAL POTENTIAL
#
### lloc angular momentum whose semi-local psp is taken as local.  lloc=4
###      denotes a smooth polynomial continuation of the all-electron
###      potential.  If lloc<=lmax, remaining data are ignored, but
###      must be there (zeros are OK).  The rc corresponding to lloc
###      MUST BE THE MINIMUM rc for lloc<=lmax, or <= the minumum for
###      lloc=4 (usually the best choice)
### lpopt type of polynomial continuation for lloc=4. values 1-5 
###       permitted.
###     1) match 2 derivatives, r^0,2,4
###     2) match 2 derivatives, r^0,4,6
###     3) match 3 derivatives, r^0,4,5,6
###     4) match 3 derivatives, r^0,4,6,8
###     5) match 3 derivatives, r^0,2,4,6
### dvloc0 shift of r=0 potential from basic continuation (Ha) for lloc=4
###        depends on lpopt above as follows, with x=(r/rc)
###        1) dvloc0*(1-x^2)^3
###        2) dvloc0*(1-x^4)^3
###        3-5) dvloc0*(1-x^4)^4

# VANDERBILT-KLEINMAN-BYLANDER PROJECTORs
#
### l angular momentum
### nproj number of projectors, 1 or 2.  automatically set to 0 for l=lloc
### debl energy  added to basic psp  energy ep for 2nd projector
###      automatically reset to match 2nd projector with 2nd bound state
###      at this l when it is occupied (ie., the psp is generated for a
###      correcponding-l shallow core state)
#
# l, nproj, debl  (lmax+1 lines, l's in order)

# MODEL CORE CHARGE
#
### icmod 0: no non-linear core correction charge. 1: smooth monotonic
###       polynomial model core charge fit at "matching" rc following
###       reference 35. For icmod = 2, 3, 4 see doc/core_correction.txt
### fcfact radius for above determined by  rho_core(r)=fcfact*rho_pseudo_
###        valence(r) values 0.25-0.5 are usually good (look at plots)
###       For icmod = 3, fcfact has a different meaning and a third
###       artument rcfact is added (see core_correction.txt)
###       For icmod = 4,, fcfact is ignored but must be present (0.0 OK)
#
# icmod, fcfact, (rcfact)
    0    0.25
#
# LOG DERIVATIVE ANALYSIS
#
### epsh1 lower energy limit for "phase-shift-like" log-derivative plots
###       should be below the nearest core level for this l to make sure
###       there are no ghosts, but -2.0 Ha usually is OK  When semi-cores
###       are treated as valence, this should be below the lowest core
###       energy
### epsh2 upper energy limit, 2.0 usually good
### depsh energy mesh interval for plot, 0.02 usually good enough
#
# epsh1, epsh2, depsh
   -2.0  2.0  0.02
#
# OUTPUT GRID
#
### rlmax maximum radius for Abinit psp code 8 format output.  must be
###       greater than maximum rc (including lloc=4 rc), but also determines
###       range of diagnostic plots, so  ~2-3*rcmax is usually good
### drl mesh spacing of linear radial mesh for Abinit output. 0.02 is good
###     for "softer" psps, 0.01 is probably better with 1st row, 3d's, or
###     semi-core psps.

# TEST CONFIGURATIONS
#
### ncnf number of test configurations (<=4)  The reference config is always
###      run first as a consistency check.  core always is the reference core
###      configuration.  The excitation energy of the configuration for the
###      pseudo-atom will be compared with the all-electron result.
