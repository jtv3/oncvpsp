! generalized Thomas-Fermi atomic potential

!...to an article of N. H. March ( "The Thomas-Fermi Approximation in 
! Quantum Mechanics", Adv. Phys. 6, 1 (1957)). He has the formula,
! but it is not the result of his work. The original publication is: 
!     R. Latter, Phys. Rev. 99, 510 (1955).
! He says that it''s an analytic fit to an improved calculation of the 
! potential distribution of a Thomas-Fermi atom without exchange first 
! performed by Miranda (C. Miranda, Mem. Acc. Italia 5, 285 (1934)).
