For 3.2.3, Ge and Hg now test the "both" option to generate both psp8 and
upf files in the *.out file as discussed in the release notes.  The 
corrections to icmod=2, 3, and 4 as discussed in the notes cause small
changes in the model core charge listing and Teter analyses, and the new
tests/refs reflect these changes.

Note that for 3.2.1 the following files have been changed to test the
new model core charge and wave function output features:

    80_Hg.dat  (psfile = upf, relativistic)
    79_Au.dat  (icmod = 2, relativistic)
    34_Se.dat  (icmod = 3)
    40_Zr.dat  (icmod = 4)

Item 6 in the 3.2.1 release_notes motivated the following changes:

    52_Te.dat  (lmax -> 3)
    56_Ba.dat  (lmax -> 3)
    

These input files produce all the Vanderbilt 2-projector psps used in the
paper.  K_st and Si_st correspond to K* and Si*.  The corresponding KB
potentials can be produced by changing nproj to 1.

Files for additional elements produce satisfactory-appearing pseudopotentials,
but have not necessarily been tested for solids.

All of these files run satisfactorily with ../run.sh (scalar-relativistic)
and ../run_r.sh (fully relatiistic).  The relativistic (*_r.out) files
have only been included in the refs for 52_Te 74_W, 79_Au and 80_Hg.

The 83_Bi file uses iexc = -101130 (PBE) which is accepted for builds with
the libxc library. It is equivalent to iexc = 4 (PBE) with the built-in exc 
functions.  Running this when oncvpsp is built without libxc will exit with 
an error message.

Files beyond those in the paper have not necessarily been tested with 
one KB projector.

The 14_Si_UPF file produces PWSCF-compatible input which can be extracted
from the 14_Si_UPF.out file with the ../extract.sh script.  The 52_Te
data has been modified setting pspfile=upf to illustrate the relativistic
form of upf data in the refs.

The 60_Nd_GHOST.dat is simply to illustrate the 3.3.1 ghost detection
capabilities.  Read doc/ghosts.txt for more details.  It should not be used
in applicatiions without the modification discussed there.
